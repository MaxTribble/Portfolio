# React Profile

## Description

I built this profile to showcase my work over the duration of the DU coding Bootcamp. I wanted to show some of my work as well as sharpen my skills with react. I learned a lot about the routing of pages using react and how that deployment interacts with GitHub.

## Credits

I would like to credit everyone at the DU Bootcamp for making it this far. These projects are a representation of many hours of frustration, growing and learning. My groupmates, TAs, and teacher have all been a vital part of making these challenges possible. For the react itself, I credit the class work where we made our own React apps in the class repo and used them to showcase the features of React.
